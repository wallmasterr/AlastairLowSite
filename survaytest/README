WHAT'S NEW
----------

This README is for SurveySays v2.0.  Major changes since the 1.x tree
include: 

* vastly improved file-locking;  when properly setup, it should be next
  to impossible for the script to lose the data

* you can now use cookies to track who has voted, as well as the IP
  caching

* "view results" button replaced with sleeker and better-working text
  link

* you can now choose to order results by the order given in @CHOICES or
  from low to high, as well as the default high to low

* you can now choose to display a "come back later for results" message
  until X votes have been received

* vastly improved error-reporting

* there is now only one script, instead of two (it wasn't really gaining
  much, and it confused some people)

* you can now set a poll to "archive" so that it only displays results
  without accepting further votes (although this is really dumb, as
  explained in the comments of surveysays.pl)

SETUP
-----

This probably should not be the first CGI script you ever try to setup. :)
It's not complicated if you know a bit about it, but, if you don't...  I'd
recommend reading some tutorials on CGI before you start, or asking a sys
admin friend for help. :)

Each variable is well-commented in surveysays.pl -- you can use the comments
as guidelines helping you to set them correctly.  A few further notes:

 a) Use full paths for all files and directories.  A full path would
    look similar to:

    /usr/home/you/data.txt

    In UNIX, you can use the command "pwd" to get the full path of
    your current working directory.  If you don't have telnet 
    access or host on NT, try asking your sys admin if you are unsure
    of the full path.

 b) The following UNIX permissions are needed for the various parts

    chmod 755 surveysays.pl

    In order for the script to create its data file on the first
    run, the directory where it should be placed (specified by you
    in poll.pl) should be "chmod 777".  If you choose to create the
    file yourself (with "touch FILENAMEHERE" in UNIX), then you 
    should "chmod 777" the file itself.

    Those permissions might be overkill -- ask your sys admin for the
    minimum needed to allow the web server to write to the file.

    If you are using NT, make sure that the poll.pl and surveysays.pl
    scripts are executable by the server, and that the data file
    can be written to by the web server.

The usage of this script requires "Server Side Includes" (SSI).  In a
nutshell, this is a type of document that the server looks through
before sending to the web browser.  Any special SSI tags are 
processed and replaced with their output.

In order to add a poll to your page, you must add an SSI tag to your
document.  For the Apache server, this would look like:

<!--#exec cgi="/cgi-bin/surveysays.pl" -->

If the script is set up properly, the poll should appear in place of
this tag when the page is called via a web browser.  Note that your
tag might be slightly different, depending on the name of your 
surveysays.pl file and it's location in your web tree.

On most servers, a file must have a .shtml extension (index.shtml, for
example) in order to use SSI.  If that doesn't seem to work, check
with your sys admin to ensure you can use SSI, and to find out how to
do so.

If, when viewing the page through a browser, the poll doesn't appear,
try checking the source code ("View Source" under the View menu in
Netscape).  If the SSI tag is in the source code, then the server did
not treat the page as an SSI document.  If it does not appear, then
the server tried but was unable to execute the script.  Check your
variables again, and double-check all the permissions.

There are a number of error messages that might be displayed within the
poll box itself if something goes wrong.  They include:

  "Couldn't lock file"

    The web server was not able to open the file listed in $SEMAPHORE.
    Make sure that the path to it is correct and that the web server has
    write permissions to that file.

  "Error opening file"

    The web server was not able to open the data file listed in $DATAFILE.
    Make sure that the path to it is correct and that the web server has
    read and write permissions to that file.
 
  "Error writing file"

    The web server was not able to write to the data file listed in $DATAFILE.
    Make sure that the path to it is correct and that the web server has
    read and write permissions to that file.

  "Data file corrupted"

    The data file ($DATAFILE) has become corrupt.  This likely means you
    need to delete it and start over.  If you are using $TMP_DIR, this
    should be next to impossible on a moderm UNIX system.

  "Number of choices has changed"

    You can't change the number of choices mid-poll.  If you do, this error
    will occur.  (Well, you can if you edit both the script and the data
    file, but you are on your own with that.)

  "Error unlocking file"

    An error occurred closing the file in $SEMAPHORE.  This error should
    never happen, really.

SUPPORT
-------

No support is provided for this application.

There is a BBS on-site at http://www.pingpackets.com/ where you can interact 
with other users and ask questions if you'd like. In this way, you can help
each other out.

If you are unable to get a script to work and are anxious to use it, I 
recommend finding someone qualified to help you with it. I do not, and will
not, however, endorse any specific person or business. I highly recommend 
taking all normal business precautions (legal contracts, etc.) when
choosing someone to help you.

Please do not e-mail me with script-related questions, with the exception of 
security issues.
